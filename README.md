# SimHash Algorithm Implementation in Python and Golang

This repository contains implementations of the SimHash algorithm in both Python and Golang. The SimHash algorithm is a technique for generating a fingerprint or hash value for a given text, which can be used for various purposes such as near-duplicate detection, similarity estimation, and more.

## Key Features

-   Consistent implementation of the SimHash algorithm in Python and Golang
-   Generates identical SimHash values for the same input text across both languages
-   Utilizes SHA-1 hashing for generating the initial hash value
-   Converts the hash value to a binary representation
-   Calculates the weight of each bit position in the binary hash
-   Generates the final SimHash value based on the weights
