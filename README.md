# SimHash Algorithm Implementation in Python and Golang

This repository contains implementations of the SimHash algorithm in both Python and Golang. The SimHash algorithm is a technique for generating a fingerprint or hash value for a given text, which can be used for various purposes such as near-duplicate detection, similarity estimation, and more.

## Key Features

- Consistent implementation of the SimHash algorithm in Python and Golang
- Generates identical SimHash values for the same input text across both languages
- Utilizes SHA-1 hashing for generating the initial hash value
- Converts the hash value to a binary representation
- Calculates the weight of each bit position in the binary hash
- Generates the final SimHash value based on the weights

## Getting Started

To use the SimHash algorithm in your Python or Golang projects, follow these steps:

### Python

1. Clone the repository or download the `simhash.py` file.
2. Include the `simhash.py` file in your project.
3. Call the `simhash` function with your input text:

   ```python
   from simhash import simhash

   text = "Your input text here"
   simhash_value = simhash(text)
   print(simhash_value)
   ```

### Golang

1. Clone the repository or download the `simhash.go` file.
2. Include the `simhash.go` file in your project.
3. Call the `simhash` function with your input text:

   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "fmt"
       "path/to/simhash"
   )

   func main() {
       text := "Your input text here"
       simhashValue := simhash.Simhash(text)
       fmt.Println(simhashValue)
   }
   ```
